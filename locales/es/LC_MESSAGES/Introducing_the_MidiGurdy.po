"Hold and play it as you would do with an acoustic hurdy-gurdy. To hear "
"the produced sounds, attach headphones or connect the instrument to an "
"external amplifier or mixing desk. If you have an acoustic hurdy-gurdy, "
"use the the mechanical features and software settings to change the "
"playing feel and sound to match them to your acoustic instrument."

"No acoustic sound production means (nearly) maintenance-free playing: no "
"strings to tune, no cotton to replace, no rosin to be applied to the "
"wheel. Simply pick up the instrument, switch it on and start playing "

"The crank reacts with high precision to your right-hand technique. A "
"physically adjustable brake allows you to change the required force to "
"turn the wheel. A non-vibrating string inside the tangent box with "
"adjustable tension and the movable sensor tangents on the keys allow you "
"to change the playing feel of the keyboard. And the keys are pressure "
"sensitive, offering many of the sound-shaping possibilities of acoustic "
"instruments."
