"Open up the tangent box lid by grabbing the protruding end on the side "
"towards the wheel cover. Push or pull it upwards with a little force to "
"separate it from the magnets holding it in place. The lid is connected to"
" the body via a small cable, so please make sure you donâ€™t pull the lid "
"away too far without unplugging the cable."

"Use the screwdriver to shift the screw and attached key sensor forwards "

"Only tighten the screws of the key sensor with a small amount of force! "
"Ideally you should use a screwdriver with a thin handle to turn the "
"screw, reducing the force you can apply to the screw.  The key sensor "

msgid "Recalibration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Adjusting_the_Keyboard.rst:88
msgid ""
"The key sensors are very sensitive to the amount of force with which they"
" are pressed against the string. This means that larger changes to the "
"string tension or a significant change in key travel might make it "
"necessary to recalibrate the keyboard sensors."

"To recalibrate the keyboard, please connect the MidiGurdy to a computer "
"to access the Web-Interface. Then choose the recalibration function from "
