Introducing the MidiGurdy
=========================

The MidiGurdy is a fully electronic hurdy-gurdy that is designed to have a
playing-feel as close to an acoustic hurdy-gurdy as possible.

Intended use
------------

The main purpose of the MidiGurdy is to be tool for rehearsal, learning and
teaching hurdy-gurdy playing techniques.

Hold and play it as you would do with an acoustic hurdy-gurdy. To hear the
produced sounds, attach headphones or connect the instrument to an external
amplifier or mixing desk. If you have an acoustic hurdy-gurdy, use the the
mechanical features and software settings to change the playing feel and sound
to match them to your acoustic instrument.

Attach the instrument to a computer to see a visual representation of your
trompette technique. See where you place your coups and check the speed of your
crank. Or use the visualisation to teach your trompette technique to others.

The MidiGurdy is also a new electronic musical instrument in it’s own right.
You can use it as a MIDI-controller to control external synthesizers or use the
built-in software synthesizer with non-hurdy-gurdy sounds.

Features
--------

No maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No acoustic sound production means (nearly) maintenance-free playing: no
strings to tune, no cotton to replace, no rosin to be applied to the wheel.
Simply pick up the instrument, switch it on and start playing right away.

Realistic control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The crank reacts with high precision to your right-hand technique. A physically
adjustable brake allows you to change the required force to turn the wheel. A
non-vibrating string inside the tangent box with adjustable tension and the
movable sensor tangents on the keys allow you to change the playing feel of the
keyboard. And the keys are pressure sensitive, offering many of the
sound-shaping possibilities of acoustic instruments.

Extensible hurdy-gurdy sounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MidiGurdy comes pre-loaded with a selection of hurdy-gurdy sounds sampled
from real instruments. And you can change them or add new sounds to your
liking.

Nine strings – in any key or tuning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three melody, three drone and three trompette strings you can
configure and control individually.

Practice anywhere - in silence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Playing with headphones means you can play even late at night without
disturbing anyone. And the smaller form factor compared to most acoustic
instruments make it more portable.

Two interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many of the MidiGurdy features can be controlled via the buttons and display on
the instrument itself, but also more comfortably via a Web-Browser when you
connect the MidiGurdy to your computer.

Open to all
~~~~~~~~~~~

The MidiGurdy software and sounds are all released under an Open-Source license
and new versions will always be free of charge.
