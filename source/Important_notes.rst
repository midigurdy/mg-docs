Important notes
===============

Handling and maintenance
------------------------

.. warning::

    Always grab the instrument by the body or the rear tangent box support.
    Never carry or lift the instrument by the keyboard or individual keys!

*   Use a soft, dry cloth to clean the instrument, which may be slightly moistened if necessary.

*   Never use petrol, thinner, alcohol or similar cleaning agents to avoid
    damaging or discolouring the surface of the instrument.

*   All user-adjustable screws and controls should only ever be hand-tightened.
    Never tighten the screws or tuning knobs with great force.


Precautions for batteries
-------------------------

* The required ambient temperature depends on the batteries used. Refer to the
  battery documentation. Never use or store the batteries in extremely hot
  places, e.g. in direct sunlight, in a closed vehicle or near a radiator. This
  could lead to leakage of battery fluid and shorten the battery life.

* Keep the batteries dry and ensure that the connections are never exposed to
  moisture. This could lead to overheating or rusting on the battery and on the
  connections.

* Make sure that batteries are never within the reach of small children.

* Never hit the batteries or drop them. Strong shocks can lead to leakage of
  battery fluid, excessive heat generation, explosion or fire.


Further Precautions
-------------------

* Handle the controls and connectors of the instrument with due care.
  Excessive handling can lead to damage.

* Never press or hit the display or place heavy objects on it.

* When making or removing the connections, pull only on the plugs - never on
  the cables. This will prevent any damage to the cables and the instrument.

.. warning::

    The instrument should only be serviced by an expert. Before opening the
    base plate, the instrument must be disconnected from all power sources
    (power supply, USB connection, battery).

.. danger::

    Only use the original 5V power supply to power the instrument via the
    power connector.  And only connect the 5V power supply to a suitable
    power outlet. Never plug it into an outlet of another voltage.
