Troubleshooting
===============

If the instrument does not work as expected, please try to identify the problem
by following the instructions below. If your problem is not listed or cannot be
solved with the given hints, please use the support forum at
https://forum.midigurdy.com or contact us directly.


The instrument turns off for no apparent reason or sometimes doesn't start at all
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* If you have a device plugged into the USB host port (maybe a USB stick or a
  USB-to-MIDI converter), remove the device and see if the problem persists.


**If you are powering the MidiGurdy only via the USB port:**

* Use a shorter USB cable and / or use a different USB port on the connected
  device.

* If using a phone charger as power supply via USB, use a different phone
  charger that can deliver more power.

* Insert charged batteries into the instrument. The batteries can compensate
  for the current peaks if the connected device cannot supply enough current.

* Connect the supplied power supply


**If you are powering the MidiGurdy via the 5V power supply:**

* Check the polarity of the batteries

* Use a different power source, like USB or batteries. Maybe the power supply
  is faulty.

**If you are powering the MidiGurdy only via batteries:**

* Replace the batteries with new or freshly charged ones



The instrument does not produce any sound when turning the crank
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Ensure that you have connected working headphones to the MidiGurdy
  headphone connector

* Make sure you have loaded a sound for at least one of the strings.

* Check the :ref:`main volume <volume-menus>` and the :ref:`string volume <common-string-items>`



My stereo headphones sound like they output two identical mono signals
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Turn the :ref:`balance of a sounding string <common-string-items>` to the
  far left or far right to check the stereo balance.

* Ensure that you are using a TRS-style connector (a headphone plug with
  only three sections on the plug). TRRS-style connectors (with four
  sections, as found on many headsets and headphones with microphones or
  volume controls) might not work as expected.

* If you are using a 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter for your headphones, ensure that it
  is a stereo adapter and that it works as expected by testing it on another
  device.



I hear a lot of noise or humming when connecting the instrument to an external speaker or other sound device
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Make sure you are using the supplied Y-cable and the breakout box to properly
  separate the MidiGurdy from the external device. See
  :ref:`other-sound-equipment` on how to connect the MidiGurdy to external sound
  devices.

* Check if the casing of the plug inserted into the headphone socket is made
  of metal and touches the front cover shielding the connectors. A
  connection between plug and front cover might lead to ground loops and a
  lot of noise in the output.
